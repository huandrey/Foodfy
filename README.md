## :rocket: About this repo
<p 'text-align=justify'>
This recipe site was developed as a challenge for the Rocketseat Launchbase Bootcamp, class 4. Basic web technologies were used at the beginning (HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT). Subsequently, the back-end was made using Node.js. As soon as the project became big, a template engine, called nunjucks, was implemented. This, in turn, facilitated the use of programming logic and code reuse in the structure that was previously html.
